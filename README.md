# Generate figures for scientific publication

manuscript-figs-cmg

Code to generate figures for a manuscript on the magnetic properties of Co2MnGa, a Heusler alloy. The data is not yet uploaded on GitHub, but the jupyter notebooks still display.
These notebooks use Pandas and Matplotlib to turn raw scientific data into publication ready figures.

The manuscript was published in 2017 in Applied Physics Letters:

Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Co2MnGa and its anomalous Hall effect
